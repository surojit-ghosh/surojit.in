## 💡 Inspiration
I built Fusion to address the lack of modern, user-friendly tools for support teams in fast-growing startups. My goal was to create a dashboard that is both powerful and easy to use.

## 👨‍💻 My Role
- Designed the UI/UX from scratch
- Implemented the full-stack architecture (Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL)
- Set up CI/CD and cloud deployment

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Advanced Next.js App Router patterns
- Real-time data handling with Prisma and PostgreSQL
- Building accessible, themeable UIs with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Challenges & Solutions
- **Hydration mismatches with theme-based images:** Solved by using CSS filters for dark mode compatibility.
- **Real-time analytics:** Used efficient database queries and caching for fast dashboard updates.
